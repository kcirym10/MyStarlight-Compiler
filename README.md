  - Started project development and github repository
  
- Week 1:
  - Received the approval of syntax diagrams and DNF rules
  - Implemented Lexer with complete token matching
  - Implemented Parser rules
  
- Week 3:
  - Implemented the neural points
  - Created the semantic cube

  - Constants are saved in global VARS Table with their virtual address
  - Variables are assigned a memory address
  - Avail and local addresses reset after exiting local scope
  - Expressions and assignment quadruples completed
  - IF-ELSE statement quadruples completed
  - WHILE statement quadruples completed
  - Removed parentRef and added address to symbol table records
  - Fixed bugs in semantic cube
  - Fixed bug which saved constants by their numeric value which meant floats and ints shared the same address
